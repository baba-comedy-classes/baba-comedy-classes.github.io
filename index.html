                      In every stage of life its difficult to define you. What you were, is not your end, what your are is not stable
                      and what you want to become is not certain. I want to achieve multiple things which starts from creating amazing
                      software products and then never ending experiments and struggle to prove myself important in the world
                      of psychological and scientific drama.

                          That time voice commands and outputs were not common like we have now easily in our mobiles.
                          When you speak any name it was searching that profile and telling everyhing about that on speaker off course
                          displaying it in parallel.
                          I faculty found good funny moments when after wathing this they said, if its not entering new data by voice, its useless.
                          True, but was not acceptable to me for my hardwork.

                        <p>
                          Google App Engine, the web hosting platform by Google was free that time. 
                          I created solutions for customer to represent their business online.
                          It used to have admin panel to edit dynamic content of website and 
                          all front end pages with customer's preferred domain name, including one gmail business email.
                          <br/>
                          This was my first software solution for mid level business to represent them online and getting leads.
                          Managing everything withing free tier and reliable service I invented that revenue model for me :)

                        <p>
                          This was very interesting project.
                          I was interested in developing something where you don't write code, you write instructions that generates code.
                          In this project I created applicaiton architecture where the software can be created, modified or extended by defining 
                          database entities and their mutual realations. Frontend and Backend was dynamically created. Deployment was also
                          interesting, I wrapped everything in a virtual machine, I was delievering these virtual machines to end user.

                        <p>
                        I developed multiple U.S. based e-commerce centric projects using Magento. Magento is an e-commerce programmable product.
                        It was very easy to start a project from the very first day using magento then modifying the logic and updating the
                        UI theme to suite the customer need, was the development journey.

                        PHP was very popular that time, I handeled projects on many frameworks and CMS like CodeIgniter, Drupal, Laravel, Wordpress etc. 
                        Customizing wordpress was the quickest solution and to create enterprise level service Laravel was having best coding practices.

                        When world of webistes changed from dynamic to realtime, front end frameworks played perfect role in managing
                        huge and highly organized web applications and with websocket two syncing made it realtime. I handled multiple
                        projects on Angular, React, Material Designs, Socket.io, MongoDB, Node.js etc.
